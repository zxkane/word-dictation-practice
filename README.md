# Word Dictation Practice

This is a web application built with [Next.js][nextjs] and [Material UI][mui], designed for English word dictation practice and helping computer beginners track their keyboard input efficiency. It's almost completed with AI Copilot in [Cursor][cursor] with Claude Sonnet 3.5 v2. See the [blog post][blog-post] for more details.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
